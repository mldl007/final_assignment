    "<h3>SINCE FINDING COSINE SIMILARITY BETWEEN TEXT EMBEDDINGS HAVING 768 DIMENSIONS AND 50,000 SAMPLES IS REALLY RESOURCE INTESIVE. I CAME UP WITH A TECHINIQUE THAT IS LESS RESOURCE INTENSIVE. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY REDUCING THE DIMENSIONS FROM 768 TO 150. THEN THE SAMPLES ARE ASSIGNED TO CLUSTERS. DURING INFERENCE THE NEWS SAMPLES ARE FILTERED BASED ON THE CLUSTER Of INPUT NEWS. THIS HEAVILY REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES FOR WHICH COSINE SIMILARITY MUST BE COMPUTED. "
